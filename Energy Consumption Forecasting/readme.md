# **Energy Consumption Forecasting with Exogenous Factors**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes energy consumption patterns using time series analysis (TSA) techniques while integrating exogenous factors such as weather conditions and holiday indicators. The aim is to build a robust forecasting model that provides insights into energy demand fluctuations over time. The dataset combines daily energy usage records from households, detailed weather data, and UK bank holidays to create a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing energy consumption.


## **Key Learnings**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    
    - Combining datasets from multiple sources (energy, weather, holidays) requires meticulous preprocessing to ensure consistency and accuracy.
    - Handling missing values and creating derived features, such as average energy per household, were critical steps in enriching the dataset.
2. **TSA Methodology**:
    
    - Testing for stationarity and performing differencing were essential to ensure the series met model assumptions.
    - Decomposition into trend, seasonality, and residuals helped uncover hidden patterns in the data.
3. **Model Development**:
    
    - SARIMAX proved to be an effective tool for time series forecasting when combined with external predictors.
    - The importance of hyperparameter tuning (e.g., order of ARIMA terms and seasonal components) was evident in achieving optimal model performance.
4. **Visualization and Insights**:
    
    - Time series visualizations allowed for clear interpretation of seasonal and weather-related trends.
    - Correlation matrices provided valuable insights into how weather variables impact energy consumption.

## Key Observations

1. **Energy-Weather Relationship**:
    
    - A clear correlation was observed between average energy consumption and temperature extremes (both high and low).
    - Humidity and cloud cover also exhibited noticeable effects on energy demand, reflecting possible heating and cooling patterns.
2. **Seasonality and Trends**:
    
    - Decomposition of the time series revealed strong seasonal components, likely driven by changes in weather and daylight across months.
    - Long-term trends indicate an increase in energy consumption during certain periods, possibly due to seasonal shifts or societal behaviors.
3. **Holiday Effects**:
    
    - Energy demand exhibited a noticeable drop during public holidays, highlighting behavioral shifts in household energy usage patterns.
4. **Model Performance**:
    
    - The **SARIMAX model** (Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables) demonstrated the ability to capture energy demand dynamics effectively.
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) were used to evaluate model accuracy, with reasonable performance metrics achieved.
  
## Recommendations

1. **Operational Decision-Making**:
    
    - Utilities and policymakers can use this model to anticipate energy demand surges during extreme weather events or specific seasons.
    - Incorporating predictive insights into load balancing systems can improve grid reliability and efficiency.
2. **Further Data Integration**:
    
    - Adding more granular data, such as hourly energy usage or real-time weather updates, can enhance model accuracy.
    - Including socio-economic factors (e.g., population density, income levels) may uncover deeper patterns.
